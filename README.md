# DevOps Toolbox ⚙️

This repository contains a collection of tools, scripts, and configurations aimed at automating common tasks in development, deployment, and project maintenance. It is part of my learning and practice in DevOps environments and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🎯 Objective

To document and centralize DevOps processes used in real-world environments, focused on:

- Automating local and production environments
- Working with containers (Docker)
- Deployment scripting
- CI/CD configuration
- Infrastructure as Code best practices
